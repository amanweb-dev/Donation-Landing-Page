            <p>Donating to the causes you care about not only benefits the charities themselves, it can be deeply rewarding for you too. Millions of people give to charity on a regular basis to support causes they believe in, as well as for the positive effect it has on their own lives.</p>

        <p>Subscription donations are monetary gifts that are automatically billed to a donor at a specified time interval. Donations can be set to be routed from a donor weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or at any other frequency, your nonprofit wants to offer. Historically, we've thought of this as a “recurring” donation.</p>
